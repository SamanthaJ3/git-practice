                <h4>Practice Makes Perfect!</h4>
                <p>My favorite quote is from a great flute instructor, Trevor Wye. - "It is a matter of time, patience, and intelligent work." - 
                    I believe it applies to many things besides flute playing including programming. So know learning to code takes time and 
                    practice strategetically!

                <p>I believe it applies to many things besides flute playing including programming. So know learning to code takes time and 
                    practice strategetically!</p>

                <h4>Be Curious!</h4>
                <p>If you have an idea dive in and make it happen. If you wonder what will happen if you change this, try it. 
                </p>

                <p>Looking up how to do new things and trying them out expands your knowledge base. Playing with the code and making changes to 
                    it furthers your understanding of how it works.
                </p>

                <h4>Get a Good Code Editor!</h4>
                <p>Using a good code editor that highlights the structure of your code helps you to identify and repair syntax errors. This helps you avoid 
                    chasing bugs that come down to just a missing semicolon. So upgrade from notepad everyone!
